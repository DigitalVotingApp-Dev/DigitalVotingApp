[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/account-security-quickstart-django.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/account-security-quickstart-django)

A simple Python and Django implementation of a website that uses Twilio Account Security services to protect all assets within a folder. Additionally, it shows a Phone Verification implementation.
